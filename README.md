# ShopiaStore
Hello there! I can see that you have provided an overview of the features and functions of your e-commerce website. I've made a few adjustments to the grammar and syntax for clarity:

- Home Page: This page contains the header section, showcasing new arrivals added by the admin, as well as news, new products, and offers provided by the company.
- Shop Page: Here, all the products available for sale are displayed. Users can utilize the filter button to find specific products and also use the search input for convenience.
- Product Page: Clicking on a product will take users to its dedicated page, which is identified by the product's unique ID.
- Cart Page: When users click on the "Add to Cart" button, the selected items are stored in the local storage, associated with the user's name and role.
- Wishlist Page: By clicking on the heart button of a product, users can save it to their wishlist, which is stored in the local storage.
- Contact Page: Users can fill out the provided form on this page to send messages. These messages are saved and can be viewed in the admin section.

Admin Role: The Admin Page consists of the following sections:
- Messages: This section displays all the messages written by users.
- Orders: It contains a list of all the orders placed by users. The admin can process these orders and mark them as completed.
- Add Product: This page allows the admin to add new products. The functionality of this page depends on the CRUD operations implemented by the backend.

LocalStorages Used:
